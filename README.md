# Weekend To Do List App

## Description

*Duration: Weekend Project*

This to do list is a fullstack full CRUD app. Users can input tasks and any notes they may want to add in the supplied fields. The task will be stored in the server and displayed in the table for easy reading. The complete button will record the time completed and also update the color of the task to show its new status. Users can also delete a task if their table is getting too full or if they don't need to do that task anymore.
